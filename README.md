In this assignment, I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. 
I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables, created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, imported  each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 
 For data analysis I did  the following:
-Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
-Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
